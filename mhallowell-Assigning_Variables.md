## Assigning Variables

This may seem like a basic concept, and for some it is, but I believe that understanding the basics is key to becoming more advanced.

Assigning variables allows you to name a value to call upon it later. This can decrease clutter in your code, and make sure you don’t accidentally mess up the value any of the times you put it in. Variables can be changed at later times in the code, so once you assign a value that’s doesn’t have to be its forever value

For my most basic code I just assigned “light” to lightlevel. The code itself doesn’t do anything, but it shows how to assign a variable.

The second code is showing how to call a variable. I assigned “NewLight” to any light level less than or equal to 100. I then use an if-statement and put the variable in place of where I would have a value. I used this to prove it would work with a variable, but I also switched back to a direct value to show that they work the same way. The code was directed to show red if the value or variable was true and off if not.

The next code it a bit more complex. I assigned three groups of values to three names: “LowLight”, “MidLight”, and “HighLight”. Similar to the last code, I used an if-statement to demonstrate a variable in place of a value. I set colors depending on each light brightness to show that it works the exact same way as if it were values in place of the variables.

My last code gave an example of the convenience of using variables because I called on some multiple times. It would’ve been more difficult, cluttered, and time consuming to write out the values each time. Assigning these once and being able to call their name simplifies things greatly. It’s the same as my third code, but I added a sound if either of two things were true, the light level was within the values of “LowLight” or “MidLight”.

### Python 
Variables allow for naming values in ways you want to remember them. Naming in python and Makecode happen in slightly different formats. Python assigns variables with just an equal sign.

### Keywords 
There are a few names that you can’t use because python has them reserved as *keywords*. Variables can also contain upper and lowercase letters, as well as numbers, although a variable cannot begin with a number. Underscores are fine too, many times they are used to signify spaces, because spaces can’t be used in assigning variable names.
